"""
The conversation field contract — the one place that decides what a
conversation carries and where it lives.

Why this exists
---------------
Three things used to decide that independently, and none of them agreed:

  1. ``ConversationState`` (app/workflows/state.py) — the LangGraph schema
  2. ``BookingSession``   (app/models/schemas.py) — the MongoDB document
  3. four hand-written field lists in the save and load paths:

       session_mapper.state_to_session          86 explicit kwargs (save)
       session_mapper.session_fields_for_state  82 keys, dead code (load)
       context_loader._load_base_state          ~100 keys (the real load)
       booking_resume.clear_in_progress_booking_fields   38 keys (reset)

Nothing checked them against each other, so every disagreement was silent.

Why "missing from the mapper" is not "left alone"
-------------------------------------------------
``session_repository.upsert_session`` replaces the whole ``workflow_state``
field with ``session.model_dump(mode="json")``, and ``state_to_session``
builds a *fresh* ``BookingSession`` from graph state every turn. So a field
the mapper does not copy does not keep its stored value — it is rebuilt as
its pydantic default and written back. Silently, every turn.

That is the mechanism behind the bugs this contract fixes:

  ``composite_template_shown``  passed to BookingSession(...) but not a field
                                of it; pydantic's default ``extra="ignore"``
                                discarded it. Always False.
  ``applied_coupon``            never copied in either direction. Always None.
  ``upsell_shown``              same.
  ``declined_upsells``          same — a "don't re-offer this" list.
  ``last_upsell_offered``       same.
  ``soft_hold_expires_at``      on both classes, copied by neither. Always None.
  ``active_personality_mode``   same.
  ``price_override``            read into state by context_loader, never
                                copied back out.

How it works now
----------------
``DECLARED`` is derived from ``BookingSession.model_fields`` rather than
typed out, so adding a field to the model is enough to make it round-trip.
The only fields that do not round-trip are named explicitly below, with a
reason. ``tests/test_state_contract.py`` fails if any field is unclassified,
if any declared field is unmapped, or if a round-trip loses a value.

Adding a field is therefore a two-line change with a test behind it:
add it to ``BookingSession``, and either let it round-trip or add it to
``EPHEMERAL`` with a reason.
