"""
The extraction contract — the one place that decides whether a value the LLM
or the guest produced is fit to enter conversation state.

Why this exists
---------------
``understand.py`` merges roughly seventeen hand-rolled extraction branches at
a single line::

    return cast(ConversationState, {**state, **updates})

Nothing validated ``updates`` on the way out. So free text and unbounded
numbers were promoted into *typed* state fields with no check, and then
rendered back to the guest verbatim. Three production defects of 2026-09-17
were all that one mechanism:

  ``adults = 2026``           ``int | None`` accepts any int, so the year in
                              "21.10.2026" became a guest count while the
                              guest's actual "Person : 4" was ignored.
  ``room_type_preference =    ``str | None`` accepts any string, so the whole
  "one room with attached     guest sentence became a room type and was
   bathroom"``                 echoed back as "we don't have **one room with
                              attached bathroom** rooms available".
  ``feature_preferences =     An unmatchable feature emptied the catalogue —
  ["attached bathroom"]``     defect #10, already patched once at the
                              *consumption* site in ``allocation_engine.py``,
                              which is exactly why it came back at a new
                              producer site.

Every one of those was fixed individually at its own call site. That is the
whack-a-mole this module ends. There is one funnel, so there is one check.

The 2026-09-24 defect is the same lesson one layer down. ``adults = 26`` came
from the year in ``15/11/26``, which the year check below could not see — it
only recognises four-digit years, and ``26`` is a perfectly plausible
headcount. The fix is Rule 1's third check, ``number_only_in_dates``; it is
here rather than at ``understand.py:1734`` for the reason this module exists,
and it is written against the guest's message rather than the value so that it
holds for the LLM's guesses as much as for the regexes'.

Relationship to ``session_contract``
------------------------------------
``app/models/session_contract.py`` already does this for the *persistence*
direction (state → MongoDB), and derives its field list from
``BookingSession.model_fields`` so the contract cannot drift from the model.
This is the same contract for the other direction — LLM text → state —
deriving from ``ExtractedBookingData.model_fields`` for the same reason.

How to add a field
------------------
Adding a field to ``ExtractedBookingData`` fails
``tests/test_extraction_contract.py`` until it is classified here: either give
it a rule, or list it in ``PASS`` with a written reason. If you cannot write
that reason, it needs a rule.

Policy on a rejected value
--------------------------
Rejected means rejected: the value is set to ``None``, never repaired. A
recovery heuristic would be one more unvalidated guess about the same input,
which is how the original bug got in. ``validator.py`` already treats a null
field as missing, so the bot re-asks and the guest corrects in one turn.
