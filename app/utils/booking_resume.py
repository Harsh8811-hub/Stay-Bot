# ── What a reset must NOT touch ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This wipe used to be a hand-written list of 41 keys, and it drifted away from
# the session it was supposed to clear. Measured on the live bot 2026-09-17,
# right after "start fresh" -> "Yes, start fresh", these were still set:
#
#   ac_preference, ac_qualified, composite_template_shown, effective_adults,
#   effective_children, child_ages, preferred_language, conversation_language,
#   quote_presented, room_options_all, declined_upsells, applied_coupon, ...
#
# Two of them changed what the guest saw on the next booking. `search_rooms`
# skips the AC question once `ac_qualified` is true, so the new booking never
# asked it; and room sizing prefers `effective_adults` over `adults`, so the old
# party size quietly carried over. A guest who reset was not a new guest.
#
# So the list is now derived from the session contract (`PERSISTED`): a field
# added to `BookingSession` is reset without anyone remembering to add it here.
# Every field resets to its **pydantic default**, which is not a coincidence —
# `state_to_session` builds a fresh `BookingSession` from graph state every
# turn, so a field *absent* from state was already being written back as its
# default. The default is exactly "as if this field had never been set".
