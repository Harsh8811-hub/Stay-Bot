"""
WhatsApp interactive messages — reply buttons and list messages.

Builds the Meta-shaped payload for a response card of type `interactive`. The CRM
forwards `{"type": "interactive", "data": {...}}` from the bot straight to Meta
(combot_crm_v2 `webhook_receiver/views.py:305-307`), so nothing here has to know how
the message is transported.

Two things about this channel shape the whole design:

1. **Meta rejects the entire message when a limit is exceeded** — it does not truncate.
   So every title is clamped here. Letting Meta reject it means the guest receives
   *nothing*, which is worse than a slightly shortened label.

2. **The button `id` never reaches the bot.** The CRM unwraps a tap into the button's
   *title* and sends that as plain text (`webhook_receiver/views.py:119`). We keep
   emitting stable ids anyway, so that if the CRM ever forwards `button_reply.id` the
   router can prefer it with no change here. Until then, routing matches on the title,
   which is sound only because we author it — see `app/utils/button_reply.py`.
