"""Which meal plan a rate plan is, and whether it may seat a guest for free.

Two questions, and the second is the reason this module exists.

**What plan is this?** The catalogue answers it properly: `rate_types` holds
`RT_EP` / `RT_CP` / `RT_MAP` / `RT_AP`, `rate_plans` carries `rate_type_id`, and
`room_repository` already copies that onto every `RatePlan`
(`room_repository.py:204`). Until now **nothing read it** — five separate files
instead substring-matched the plan's *name* (`"cp" in rp.name.lower()`:
`booking_engine.py:106`, `amenity_service.py:200`, `quote_generator.py:164`,
`menu_handler.py:231`, `room_query_handler.py:493`). That works until a hotel
names a plan "Continental Breakfast Included", or "Room Only — CP Rate".

`classify_rate_plan` reads `rate_type_id` first and only falls back to the name
for plans synthesized without one — the hardcoded fallback plan at
`room_repository.py:154-161` builds `RatePlan(rate_plan_id=f"{room_id}_EP",
name="Room Only (EP)")` and sets no `rate_type_id`.

**Who may sit above the base occupancy for free?** Pranav, 2026-10-06:

    "On EP Plan we can allow extra person to stay in room without any extra bed
     so for example in Deluxe Room which has base_occupancy = 2 and max_adults =
     3, EP can have NO EXTRA BED (no extra charges) but that SHOULD NOT be
     allowed on MAP and CP"

So the *permission* is a property of the plan, while the *price* is a property
of the room type — "Extra person rate is for each room type and not for each
plan". The two are deliberately kept apart here: this module only says whether a
charge is owed, never how much.
