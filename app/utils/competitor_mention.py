"""Does the guest's own message name an online travel agency, or ask us to beat one?

One pattern, two readers. `understand` uses it to decide that a *general* discount
question is really a price-match request; `price_match_handler` uses it to decide
whether it may compare our rate to a portal's. Those two answers have to agree —
if the handler thinks a comparison is unasked-for while `understand` thinks the
guest raised MakeMyTrip, the guest gets routed to a price match and then told
nothing about the price they raised.

It lived inline in `understand.py` until 2026-10-14. It is a module now because
the second reader arrived, and this codebase has paid for duplicated matchers
before: three copies of "which room did the guest mean" disagreed and looped a
guest forever (`staychat-split-line-not-a-room`).

The pattern is moved here verbatim — not rewritten — so that `understand`'s
behaviour is unchanged by the extraction.
