"""One reading of what a guest means by AC.

Six places in this codebase decided, separately, whether a guest had asked for
AC or for Non-AC, and each spelled the question out as its own list of exact
strings. The lists drifted, so the same sentence resolved in one place and was
silently ignored in another — and the silent case was the expensive one. An
answer nobody could read fell through to `room_searcher`'s "default assumption
is AC", so a guest who wrote *non - ac* was shown air-conditioned rooms, and
was never told the question had gone unanswered.

Everything here runs on one normalised form of the text:

    "Non - A/C Room."   ->  "non ac room"
    "NON_AC"            ->  "non ac"
    "Air-Conditioned"   ->  "air conditioned"

Lowercased; `a/c` read as `ac`; every dash, underscore and run of punctuation
read as a space; runs of whitespace collapsed. After that the matcher has to
know four vocabularies instead of six spellings of the same four.

The hard case is that "without ac" contains the word AC, so any test of the
form "does this mention AC" answers yes to a guest who has just refused it.
Stripping the Non-AC phrases out before asking that question is what keeps the
two apart, and it happens in one place — inside the resolver, and inside
`mentions_both_classes`, which is the resolver's "they named both classes"
test published for callers that need to distinguish a guest comparing the two
from a guest asking for one.

This module reads text, and only text. `ac_preference_from_state` in
`room_packing` reads the *state enum*, where "NO_PREFERENCE" means something
the card treats differently from an unstated preference; it delegates here for
the words and keeps its own contract for the enum.
