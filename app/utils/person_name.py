"""
Read a person's name out of a guest's reply — and nothing else.

The reported defect, in Pranav's words:

    better name parsing when asking for guests name, right now when name is
    asked it takes the whole thing no matter what the customer sent

**Why it happened.** The capture at `understand.py` read `state["user_message"]`
verbatim, stripped one known prefix if the message happened to start with it,
and then accepted whatever was left so long as it was at most four words, held
no digit, and matched a letters-only regex. Every one of these passed:

    "hi i am rahul"      -> saved as  "Hi I Am Rahul"
    "Rahul English"      -> saved as  "Rahul English"   (the language swallowed)
    "rahul sharma here"  -> saved as  "Rahul Sharma Here"

The checks were looking for *reasons to reject* a whole message. None of them
was looking for a name. A greeting is short and has no digits, so it qualified.

**What this does instead: it scans.** Leading greetings, self-introduction
filler and honorifics are dropped; then the leading run of name-shaped tokens
is kept, and the scan stops at the first token that is not name-shaped — a
digit, a language name, a punctuation break, or a word no name contains. So
"hi i am rahul english" yields "Rahul" and drops the rest rather than failing.

**Deliberately not a model call.** This runs on the turn that captures the
guest's name, which is already a model turn; a second call to read two words
would cost a round trip and could still be wrong. The rules below are cheap,
deterministic, and testable, and a name they get wrong is one the guest will
see echoed back and can correct.

Pure function. No state, no I/O, no model.
