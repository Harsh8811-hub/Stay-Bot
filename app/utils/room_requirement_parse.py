"""
Multi-category room requirements, read out of a raw guest message.

"10 Double, 3 Triple" is a room request. "Cheack in 24/10/26 at 5pm" is not —
but on 2026-09-21 the second one was read as **26 rooms of whichever room sorts
first**, and the guest was quoted Rs 58,000/night for a party of twelve. The two
rooms that note was read into were literally:

    {"room_type": "at 5pm  \\ncheack out 27",       "count": 26}
    {"room_type": "kashi classic room in 4th floor", "count": 3}

Two things made that possible, and both are closed here.

  * The room-noun test was a bare substring, `any(k in rtype for k in
    ROOM_KEYWORDS)`. `"ac"` is one of those keywords and `"cheack"` contains
    `"ac"` — so the tail of a date line passed as a room name. The noun now has
    to appear as a **word**: `\\bac\\b` does not match inside `cheack`.
  * The count scan took the first digit run anywhere in the fragment. In
    `24/10/26` the `26` is a year, and the greedy tail after it became the
    "room type". A count now has to sit next to a room noun, and a number with
    a date delimiter on either side is a date, not a count.

A fragment this module cannot read yields nothing, and nothing means "leave the
caller's own extraction alone" — so a message we fail to parse is not turned
into a room request by omission. The model's `room_requirements` still stands
when this returns [].

Pure: a string in, plain dicts out. No model call, no I/O, no state, so every
guard below is tested directly.

    the second half of the same hole. The 29-room quote needed both to be
    wrong at once, and only the first is closed in the reader: "5 deluxe" for a
    party of two parses perfectly and is still not a booking.

    The rule is one line: **a room sleeps at least one guest, so a request for
    more rooms than there are guests leaves a room with nobody in it.** FOC
    rooms are exempt — a complimentary room for a driver is not a room the
    party sleeps in, so it is not counted against the party.

    All-or-nothing on purpose. The count is what is wrong, not the room type,
