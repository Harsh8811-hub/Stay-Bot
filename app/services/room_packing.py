Room packing — how many of which room a party actually needs.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The rooms card has to answer one question for every party size: *which set of
rooms seats these people, and how much does each set cost?* That is an
optimisation, not a lookup, and getting it wrong is a money bug in both
directions — a greedy pick over-charges a guest who could have been seated
cheaper, and an unchecked pick sells rooms the hotel cannot supply.

Two rules define a valid set:

  1. **The cheapest set of rooms that holds the party, each filled to its own
     real ceiling.** This rule has been rewritten twice and the two earlier
     versions are worth knowing, because both were arguing about a berth that
     does not exist.

     The client's original, 2026-09-19: *"Extra beds are not used on this card
     at all — a party that does not fit the base occupancy of the rooms it was
     given is given more rooms instead."* Reversed on 2026-09-23 by Pranav, on
     the argument that the guest is buying a place to sleep and the card should
     quote the cheapest one actually for sale — at Hotel Sahu a party of three
     saw a Deluxe Family Room at Rs 3,875 while one Deluxe King Bed with a
     mattress came to Rs 3,150, the exact room the guest had asked about, Rs 725
     cheaper and invisible.

     The reversal was right and its reasoning was wrong. The third guest was
     never on the mattress; the Deluxe King's own `max_adult_occupancy` is 3, so
     the room seats three on its own beds and the Rs 600 bought comfort, not a
     berth (see `allocation_engine.distribute_guests`, rewritten 2026-09-25).
     The card was under-quoting the room, not over-quoting it — the same room
     should have been on the card at its own rate all along, and is now.

     So the rule this module actually implements is the plain one: every room
     is packed to the ceiling the hotel states for it, a mattress is a priced
     add-on that seats nobody, and the cheapest set wins. A party of two is
     never upsold a bed, because a bedded candidate seats the same two people
     for more money and the search never reaches for it.

  2. **An option never mixes air-conditioning classes.** A party split across
     an AC and a non-AC room is not one product, and quoting it as one number
     hides that from the guest. AC is a filter on the candidate set, applied
     before anything is packed.

Why a knapsack and not a greedy pick
------------------------------------
The obvious implementation — repeatedly take the cheapest room that fits the
remaining guests — is wrong whenever a larger room is cheaper per seat than a
smaller one. If a 3-seat room costs Rs 1,850 and a 2-seat room costs Rs 1,550,
greedy fills 5 guests as 3+2 = Rs 3,400; but if a 4-seat room ever came in
under Rs 3,100 the greedy answer would miss it. `min_cost_packing` solves the
minimum over all combinations exactly, by dynamic programming over the party
size. The search space is tiny (party size x room types), so exactness is free.

The packing is unbounded: the same room type may be taken any number of times,
which is what "3 x Deluxe" means.

Grades
------
`room_grade` reads a quality word out of the room's own name:

    STANDARD  <  DELUXE  <  PREMIER  <  SUITE  <  EXECUTIVE

This is a string convention, not a field, and it is the weakest part of the
module — see the note on `room_grade`. Price is deliberately *not* used to
derive a grade: a bigger room in a cheaper grade costs more than a smaller room
in a better one, so ranking by price ranks by size and calls a Standard Triple
Bed a step up from a Standard Room. Price is used only to break ties *within* a
grade.

Pure module: no I/O, no database, no imports from the service layer. Everything
here is a function of its arguments, so the whole decision surface is testable
without a hotel.

    A hotel whose rooms are named "Kodai Hut" and "Kodai Cottage" gets both at
    index 0, so every room ties on grade and the packer falls back to price
    within the class — which still produces a correct *cheapest*, but a "comfy"
    that means "the bigger one" rather than "the better one".

    The fix is a grade field on the room document rather than a name match.
    Until that exists, this is the documented behaviour, and it degrades to
    something sane rather than raising.

    One room type offered as a packing option.

    `price` is per night, inclusive of taxes, matching what the card prints.
    `base_adults` is the boundary the packer fills to — and it is the room's
    **ceiling**, `max_adult_occupancy`, not the occupancy the room rate covers.
    A Deluxe King (base 2 / max 3) arrives here as `base_adults=3` whether or
    not anyone bought a mattress, because the hotel seats three either way.
    `is_ac` must come from `room_matches_feature(room, "AC")` at the caller, not
    from string matching here — the packer must not re-derive a fact the
    inventory layer already answers, or the two can disagree.

    `beds` is how many extra mattresses this room is sold with, and it is
    **already inside `price`** — a mattress is never sold without being paid
    for. It is **not** the difference between `base_adults` and the rate's
    occupancy; that difference is a normal guest. A Deluxe King with a mattress
    bought arrives as `base_adults=3, beds=1, price=<room rate + mattress
    charge>`; the same room with none arrives as `base_adults=3, beds=0,
    price=<room rate>`. Two candidates that seat the same three people, and the
    cheaper one wins — which is why a mattress only ever appears in a packed set
    when the guest asked for it.

    The packer deliberately does not add beds itself: the allocator already
    decided which rooms may have one, against the hotel's own
    `extra_bed_allowed` / `max_extra_beds`. Re-deriving that here would give the
    card a second opinion about a hotel's bed policy, and the two could disagree
    — the card quoting a mattress the final quote refuses, which is the
    strongest argument for keeping this a plain number the caller supplies.

    The cheapest set of rooms that seats `party`, or None if they cannot be seated.

    Exact, by dynamic programming over **two** capacities. `best[s][h]` is the
    cheapest set that fills `s` berths and holds `h` heads, both capped at what
    the party needs, where taking a room with `b` berths and `o` heads moves to
    `(min(party, s + b), min(head_party, h + o))` — so a room that over-seats
    the remainder still counts, and the answer is "at least `party` berths and
    at least `head_party` heads", not "exactly".

    Two dimensions because a room has two ceilings and they are different
    numbers. `base_adults` is how many *adults* the room sleeps; `head_capacity`
    is how many *people* the hotel will put in it. A Deluxe Room Four Bed seats
    5 adults and holds 6 people — the sixth is a child sharing a bed, who needs
    a head's worth of room and no berth of their own. On 2026-09-29 that room
    cost Rs 3,400 and the card quoted Rs 3,600 for two King rooms, because this
    search knew only about berths and so could not see that one room already
    held everyone.

    `head_party` defaults to `party`. The two are the same number whenever the
    party holds no free child — a paid child takes a berth exactly as an adult
    does, so only a child the hotel does not charge for is absent from `party` —
    which is every call site that predates this parameter. A caller that does
    not pass it keeps its exact old answer.

    Ties are broken toward fewer rooms, then toward the alphabetically earlier
    room, so the result is a deterministic function of the input. Two packings
    at the same price are not the same product to a guest — fewer rooms means
    less to walk between — so the tie-break is a real preference, not just
    test hygiene.

    Beds need no search of their own: they change a candidate's price and never
    its seats, so "1 x Deluxe, 3 seats, Rs 3,550" and "1 x Deluxe, 3 seats,
    Rs 4,150 with a mattress" are two ordinary candidates and the search takes
    the cheaper one unless the guest asked for the mattress. The bed is threaded

    The spellings are the shared reader's job (`app.utils.ac_text`), which is
    what keeps "NON_AC" here and "non - ac" in the parser from being two

    preference IS a real case for this card, so anything the reader resolves to
    "they want to see both" comes back as None rather than as a third value.
