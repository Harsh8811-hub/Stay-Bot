        # staff confirmation (`tasks.py:268,328`) and the reconciliation sweep
        # (`reconciliation_service.py:70`). This one does not, and it is the one
        # Hotel Sahu's bookings actually come through: the guest pays by UPI,
        # photographs the receipt, and the screenshot is verified here.
        #
        # Measured 2026-10-11 on `BK-20261010-94330B97` (Hotel Sahu, 11-12 Oct,
        # ₹460 of ₹1,550): the guest's whole confirmation was the one line below
        # — no dates, no room, no address, and the prices were right only because
        # `confirm_pending_booking` above had just written them. Only 5 of 412
        # bookings carry `confirmation_sent`, and the last slip of any kind went
        # out on 2026-09-01.
        #
        # This is additive. `confirm_msg` is still what the turn returns, so the
        # guest gets today's acknowledgement and then the slip — if the slip
        # fails they are no worse off than before this call existed.
        #
        # Three properties make it safe to call from here:
        #
        #   * Idempotent. `send_booking_confirmation_notification` claims
        #     `confirmation_sent` with one atomic `update_one` and returns early
        #     when another process already holds it, so a webhook or a
        #     reconciliation arriving later cannot send a second slip. It also
        #     RELEASES the claim when the send fails (`confirmation_service.py:349`),
        #     so a failed attempt here does not spend the booking's one chance.
        #   * Non-fatal. A raise is caught below; the booking is already confirmed
        #     by the call above, and the guest's reply does not depend on this.
        #   * Grounded. It re-reads the booking from Mongo, and `amount_paid` is
        #     passed so the slip's paid/balance figures are the ones just written
        #     rather than whatever the pre-call document held.
        #
        # The cost, stated plainly: `whatsapp_service.send_message` is synchronous
        # — a `requests.post` with a 10 s timeout — so a stalled send holds this
        # turn for up to ten seconds. Every existing caller already runs that way
        # (they are API routes and background jobs, where it does not matter);
        # this is the first caller on a live chat turn. Making the send async is a
        # change to `whatsapp_service`, not to this call.
