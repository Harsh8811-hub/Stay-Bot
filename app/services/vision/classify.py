Analyze this uploaded image and classify it into EXACTLY ONE of the following 6 categories:

1. "payment_proof":
   - A digital payment receipt or transaction confirmation screen (e.g. Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, UPI, net banking, debit/credit card receipt).
   - Shows transaction amount, UTR / reference number, payment status, or bank transfer details.

2. "id_card":
   - An official Government Identity Document (e.g. Indian Aadhaar Card, Passport, Driver's License, Voter ID, PAN Card, National Identity Card).
   - Shows guest name, photo, government emblem/logo (e.g. Government of India, UIDAI, Ashoka lion emblem), ID number, address, or DOB.
   - Provided by a guest for identity verification or check-in compliance.

3. "booking_note":
   - A handwritten note on paper, handwritten slip, written reservation requirements, WhatsApp message/chat screenshot of booking inquiry, or paper diary note.
   - Contains dates (check-in/check-out), guest counts (adults/children/persons), room count, or room types (e.g. "Check in - 5/11/26", "Tripple bed - 2 NOS", "6 Person").

4. "room_reference":
   - A photograph of a hotel room interior, bedroom, bed setup (e.g. 1 king bed, twin beds, 3 beds), bathroom, living area, balcony, or guest room amenities.
   - Used by a guest to ask if the hotel has similar rooms or to show what style/beds they prefer.

5. "ota_price":
   - A screenshot from an Online Travel Agency (OTA) or hotel booking website/app (e.g. MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, TripAdvisor).
   - Shows hotel room rates, dates, prices, room category names, or price comparisons.

6. "unknown":
   - Anything else: selfies, food, outdoor landscapes, memes, unrelated receipts, or blank/corrupted images.
