Identify and extract the room's visual configuration, bed setup, and visible amenities.{catalog_context}
RULES:
1. bed_count: Count how many distinct beds or mattresses are visible (e.g. 1 for King/Queen, 2 for Twin, 3 for Triple/Family, 4 for Four-bed).
2. bed_type: Classify the bed arrangement:
   - "king": 1 large double/king mattress
   - "queen": 1 standard double/queen mattress
   - "twin": 2 separate single/twin beds side-by-side
   - "single": 1 single bed
   - "triple": 3 beds or 1 double + 1 single bed
   - "family": 4 beds or 2 large double beds
   - "unknown": if beds are not clearly visible
3. room_style: Describe the style/ambiance (e.g. "Modern Deluxe with wooden accents", "Spacious Premier King with warm ambient lighting", "Classic Heritage room").
4. visible_amenities: List ONLY the amenities you can clearly see (e.g. "AC Unit", "Flat-screen TV", "Balcony", "Sofa seating", "Attached Bathroom", "Bathtub", "Study Table", "Electric Kettle", "Wardrobe"). DO NOT guess or list things not visible.
5. room_category_inferred: Suggest what category this resembles (e.g. "Deluxe Room", "Premier King Room", "Family Suite", "Standard Room").
6. features_description: A concise 1-3 sentence summary of what this room looks like.
7. confidence: Float (0.0 to 1.0) indicating clarity of the photo.{catalog_instruction}"""
