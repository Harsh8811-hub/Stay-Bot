"""
Inventory Service — date-based dynamic room availability.

Availability is sourced from the `daily_inventory` collection (per room-type,
per date `available` counts + `status`) and `daily_rates` stop-sell
restrictions, with a booking-derived fallback for dates that have no
`daily_inventory` coverage yet (the collection is only rolled forward a few
days at a time).

The service also exposes atomic `reserve_inventory` / `release_inventory`
helpers so the bot updates inventory directly when a hold is created, a
booking is confirmed, or a hold is cancelled/expired.

# statement of that order; every pricing path is expected to agree with it.
#
#   Rung 1  daily_rates, keyed (room_type_id, rate_plan_id, date)          LIVE
#           A rate set for this room, this plan, this exact night.
#
#   Rung 2  daily_rates, keyed (room_type_id, rate_type_id, date)          LIVE
#           A rate set for the meal type on this night. Accepted only when
#           the row names no plan or names ours — the sibling-plan guard in
#           `calendar_rate_for_night` below. Without that guard a sibling
#           plan's row silently overwrites our price.
#
#   Rung 3  rate_plans.base_price                                LIVE
#           The catalogue: the static fallback for any night that rungs 1
#           and 2 don't cover.
#
# `calendar_rate_for_night` walks rungs 1→2 and returns None when neither
# applies. Callers apply rung 3 themselves, because the catalogue value lives
# on the plan object rather than in the calendar — `_apply_calendar_rates` here
# and `calculate_price_breakdown` in booking_engine both do it.
#
# For a whole stay, the order of application is:
#
#   1. resolve each night          rungs 1 → 2 → 3
#   2. average the nights          `average_nightly`, rounded to 10
#   3. seasonal multiplier         LIVE — `get_active_season_modifier`
#   3b. rate threshold             LIVE — the hotel's own floor and ceiling
#   4. + extra adult/child         per the room's occupancy rules
#   5. GST                         inclusive extracts it, exclusive adds it
#   6. round to 10
#
# Step 3 is a *multiplier on a resolved rate*, not a rival rung — it scales
# whatever steps 1-2 produced, so it cannot sit in the ladder above without
# competing with the calendar.
#
# An earlier version of this comment said step 3 was reserved and that nothing
# seasonal was applied. That was wrong and had been for months: seasons really
# do move quotes (measured 2026-09-25 — a Diwali season at 1.4x, an off-peak
# night at 0.8x), and both `_apply_calendar_rates` below and
# `booking_engine.calculate_price_breakdown` apply them.
#
# Step 3b is the leash on step 3. The season multiplier is floored at 0.50 and
# has no ceiling, so it is the only unbounded modifier on a nightly rate in this
# codebase; the hotel's configured window bounds how far it may drag the price.
# Both producers apply it, against the same pre-season reference.

    One night's calendar rate for one rate plan, or None if the calendar has no

    Why it is a function and not two copies
    ---------------------------------------
    This lookup existed twice: once here in `_apply_calendar_rates` (which
    prices the room card) and once, hand-copied, in
    `booking_engine.calculate_price_breakdown` (which prices the stay summary).
    Only this copy had the sibling-plan guard below, so for five of Hotel Sahu's
    thirteen plans the card and the summary quoted different numbers for the
    same room on the same night — measured 2026-09-17, e.g. STANDARD NON AC ROOM
    at 1550 on the card and 2550 in the summary. Two copies of a rule is one
    copy too many; the second one drifted.

    The guard
    ---------
    `by_type` is keyed by rate TYPE, which every plan of the same meal plan
    shares, so it can hand back a *sibling* plan's row. A row that names a
    different plan is that plan's rate, not ours — taking it overwrites our
    price with theirs. (`daily_rates` carries RP_EA7A12 rows under six rooms at
    2550; that is how 2550 leaked onto five rooms whose own EP plans have no
    calendar rows.) A row naming no plan is a genuine type-level rate and is
    accepted.

    `rate_type_ids` is an ordered list of candidates to try, because not every
    caller knows the plan's declared type: `RoomType.rate_plans` carries
    `rate_type_id`, but `SelectedRoom` does not, so the booking engine infers a
    type from the plan's display name and passes it here. Declared first, then
    inferred — a declared type is a fact, an inferred one is a guess.
