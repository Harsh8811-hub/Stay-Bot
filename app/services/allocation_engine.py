    `paid_children` counts the children the HOTEL's own policy makes chargeable
    — the band strictly between `free_till` and `paid_till`. The validator works
    that out, because it is the only place the ages and the policy are both in
    hand; this function only turns the count into money.

    The rate is the room's `extra_child_rate`. Nothing sets it per hotel yet, so
    it is the catalogue-wide placeholder that `room_repository` puts on every
    room when the document has no rate of its own. When the real child rate
    lands on the room documents, this picks it up with no change here.

    **Not charged on top of the occupancy rule.** `distribute_guests` already
    charges a child who is past the room's `base_children` allowance, and one
    child can be both past the allowance and inside the policy band — two rules
    each billing the same child is the obvious way to get this wrong. The larger
    of the two charges wins and the other is dropped; a child is billed once.

    `fold_into_price` is a legacy of a split that no longer exists: the two
    public allocators used to differ, with `allocate_rooms_by_requirements`
    folding the charge in as well as recording it. Both keep it beside
    `price_per_night` now (2026-09-23), and both callers pass `False`.

    The flag is kept rather than removed because folding is what the *reader*
    assumes against: `calculate_price_breakdown` prices a room as
    `price_per_night + extra_adult_charge + extra_child_charge`, so a charge
    that is folded in *and* recorded is a charge the guest pays twice on any
    night the calendar does not resolve. Passing `True` does not raise — it
    silently overcharges.

    Mutates the options in place. Every total downstream — card, quote, booking
    — sums `extra_child_charge` across a set's rooms rather than recomputing it,
    so the charge has to live on a room for them all to see it.

    Every room must have at least 1 adult!

    **A mattress is not capacity.** `max_adults` is the hotel saying how many
    adults this room holds, and it holds that many with or without one — the
    field is literally `max_adult_occupancy`, the adult ceiling. `base_adults` is
    how many the room rate covers by default; the adults between `base_adults`
    and `max_adults` are ordinary guests the hotel already counts, not mattress
    berths.

    Until 2026-09-25 this function read the two fields the other way round: it
    filled to `base_adults`, then "extra" adults up to `max_adults` were seated
    by adding a mattress and charging for it. A party of three in a Deluxe King
    (base 2 / max 3) was therefore billed ₹600 for a third adult the hotel's own
    document says it seats. Worse, it taught every reader downstream that the
    third adult *was* the mattress — `room_service._card_candidates` derives the
    bed on a card row from `assigned_adults - base_adults`, so the row advertised
    "Sleeps 2" for a room that sleeps 3. A guest who declined the mattress then
    appeared not to fit, and the packer answered a party of three with two rooms
    ₹2,250 more expensive. That is the defect reported from hotel Sahu.

    So: adults fill to `max_adults` and stop. Nothing seats an adult above it,
    because the mattress never did. `wants_bed` is the guest asking for one
    outright — it prices the mattress and records it, and it changes no
    assignment, because a mattress moves nobody into the room who was not
    already in it.

    Children never take a mattress: the hotel's own policy says `kids_bed: "No"`,
    and a child above `base_children` borrows the room's unused adult headroom
    instead (see Pass 2).

    # thing keeping the search alive, and once `min_rooms_needed` reaches 5 the
    # search range collapses to a single point whose every combo is rejected by
    # the `len(combo) >= 5` guard — so `valid_options` came back empty and the
    # guest got a room card with nothing in it.
    #
    # Measured on 111111: 21 adults in a room that seats 3 needs 7 rooms, and the
    # search returned `[]`. It also degraded to one or two options at 17-20.

    # This pass runs ONLY when the search produced nothing at all, and offers the
    # smallest single-room-type combination that seats the party — the same shape
    # as the "Guarantee Single-Room-Type Options" block above, just without the
    # 4-room ceiling. It cannot change any result the engine already produces, so
    # T6's handoff behaviour for every other party is untouched.
