"""The hotel's cancellation and refund policy, in the guest's words.

One implementation, because there were about to be two. The logic here was
lifted out of `cancellation_handler.py`, which had been the only reader of
`payment_policies.cancellation_rules` — and which a confirmed guest can never
reach, because `routing.py` sends every confirmed guest to `stage_confirmed`
first. Item 4 (Pranav, 2026-10-10) needs the same text in that handler, and a
second copy of a refund table is exactly the kind of thing that drifts: one copy
gets a fix, the other keeps quoting the old percentages to a guest who is about
to lose money.

The rules are read from `payment_policies`, scoped to the hotel with a
`"default"` fallback document, and rendered as a bullet per band. A hotel with no
row — or a row with no `cancellation_rules` key — falls back to the same generic
line `cancellation_handler` has always shown, so an unconfigured hotel behaves
exactly as before.

`get_cancellation_policy_parts` is the exact-parity entry point (the two blocks
the handler prints under its own headings); `get_cancellation_policy_text` is the
combined block for callers that just want one string.
