"""
Hotel Identity — one reader for the facts a guest is told about a property.

Why this exists
---------------
The stage handlers (in-house, confirmed, checked-out) each carried their own
private copy of the hotel's name, front-desk number and map link:

    phone = "+918141459509" if is_sanidhyam else "+919453222931"

That ternary is wrong for every property it was not written for. Hotel Paradise
(376891) and Hotel Maharaja (968225) are not Sanidhyam, so they fell through to
**Hotel Sahu's number** — the R4 defect in the 3 Oct 2026 test report: one
hotel's front desk being handed to another hotel's guest.

The data was never missing. `hotel_details` already carries it for every
tenant, and `app/repositories/hotel_repository.py` already exposes canonical
readers for it (`get_hotel_contact_info`, `get_hotel_location`,
`get_hotel_by_id`). This module is the single place that decides how those
records become the strings a guest sees, so the three handlers cannot drift
apart again.

Fail-loud, not fail-to-Sahu
---------------------------
`property_router`'s own docstring states the principle — "NEVER silently fall
back to Hotel Sahu (111111) for unmapped tenants" — and this follows it. When a
property has no phone number on file, the copy degrades to "at reception"
rather than borrowing a number. When it has no known wifi credentials, the
wifi block is omitted rather than printed with another hotel's password. A
missing fact is a smaller harm than a wrong one.

What is still not in the database
---------------------------------
`hotel_details` holds exactly `property`, `contact`, `location` and
`transit_directions`. There is **no wifi field and no review-link field in any
collection**. `_KNOWN_PROPERTY_EXTRAS` below isolates those two facts, keyed by
hotel, so they are at least in one place and visible rather than buried in
control flow. They should move to `hotel_settings` — until then, a property
absent from that table simply gets no wifi block and no review link.
