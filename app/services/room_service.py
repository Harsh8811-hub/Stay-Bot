    HONEST NOTE — this returns a flat Rs 600, and the lookups around it do not
    work. It was lifted verbatim from `build_structured_multi_room_options`,
    where it read `business_config["extra_bed_rate"]`; `BusinessConfig` is
    `features` + `limits` and carries no such field, so that branch could never
    fire and 600.0 was always the answer. Replacing a dead lookup with a
    constant is the same behaviour, stated plainly, rather than a working
    lookup that looks like it does something.

    The rate a hotel actually charges is real and lives elsewhere: the hotel
    policy document's `extra_bed_rate` is read in `room_repository.py:49` and
    lands on `RoomOccupancy.extra_adult_rate` (Rs 600 at hotel 111111, Rs 500

    both read it — so a quote for 108959 is built from 500 and this fallback
    would print 600 for the same hotel. That divergence is left in place here
    on purpose: fixing it changes what this formatter prints, and this function
    is an extraction, not a fix. It is flagged for the extra-person card, which

    The one-line pitch for a room set — read off the set itself, never off its

    whatever was left over took the first entry of a rotating list of generic
    lines. That is a lie whenever the slot and the set disagree, and a live card

    shown "2 x Family Room" and "3 x Family Room" — the same room at the same
    rate, differing only in how many — and the second was labelled "Bigger
    rooms, upgraded interiors." It is the same room. There are more of them.

    So every line here is a fact about the set in hand:

        an extra bed     ->  the bed is the thing being chosen

        more than one    ->  the whole group spread across them

    """
    The price line for a room set — always per room, per night.

    Two shapes, because a mixed set has no single per-room rate:

        one room type   ->  Rs 2,550 per room / night
        a mixed set     ->  Rs 1,550 + Rs 2,950 per room / night

    An average is not used for the mixed case. The mean of 1,550 and 2,950 is
    2,250, which is neither room's price and matches nothing the guest is later
    quoted, so each distinct rate is listed instead. Rooms sharing a rate are
    listed once; how many there are is already in the title above
    ("2 x Deluxe Room").

    A room's rate here is what that room costs the guest, which is not
    ``price_per_night`` alone: an extra adult or child bed is charged on the room
    that holds it and recorded in a separate field, and ``allocate_rooms`` adds
    all three terms when it prices the set. Folding the bed charge into the room
    that carries it is what makes the parts sum to the set total — without it an
    8-guest option printed "Rs 3,880 + Rs 1,850" against a real Rs 6,330,
    understating the set by the Rs 600 extra bed it does not mention.

    The counts are not multiplied in: this is a rate, not a subtotal. And a
    breakdown is only shown for a set whose parts are *proved* to add up to that
    set's total, so both readings are tried and the one that reconciles with the
    total wins. Neither reconciling means the data is not a room set we
    understand, and the set total over the room count is then the safe line.

    The two readings exist because two callers used to disagree on where the bed
    charge lives: ``allocate_rooms`` kept it beside ``price_per_night``, while
    ``allocate_rooms_by_requirements`` folded it in *and* recorded it. They agree
    now — both keep it beside (2026-09-23, see ``allocation_engine``) — which
    makes ``with_bed`` the reading that wins on every set, including the one that
    used to reconcile against ``rate_only``. The second reading is left in place
    rather than deleted: it is the guard that keeps a card honest about a room
    set it cannot account for, and it costs one arithmetic pass.

    A free room is allowed through as ``Rs 0``: an FOC room genuinely costs
    nothing, and printing it is more honest than averaging its zero away.

    ``stay_total`` is optional and appends the whole-stay, whole-set figure
    after the rate. The rate above cannot express what separates two sets of
    the same room — "2 x Family Room" and "3 x Family Room" both read
    "Rs 3,550 per room / night", so the card showed the guest two options that
    looked identical and cost Rs 14,200 apart. The total is that difference.
    Defaults to None so every existing caller keeps the line it had.

# ── The room card (client spec, 2026-09-19) ──────────────────────────────────
#
# Two sections, from two different datasets, and that is the point of it:
#
#   ROOMS 1-4     one room TYPE, its per-night Room Only rate, its capacity
#   COMBINATIONS  one room SET, priced for the whole stay
#
# Those are different grains and they were being served from one list. Every
# previous producer rendered a single set of priced options, which is why the
# multi-room and single-room cards forked on `total_guests >= 5` and why a
# party size changed which formatter ran at all. Splitting the sections means
# one renderer serves every party size.
#
# How many PRICED rows the card can print — three, not four. The "Build your
# own" line is not one of them: the resolver reads a reply of `n` as option `n`
# for n up to this number, and `this + 1` as build your own
# (`room_card_reply._choice`). Keeping the value at three is what makes the
# third tier land on row 3 and build-your-own on row 4 without the resolver
# moving at all.
#
# `room_card_reply` also caps a stale `allocation_options` list at this, so a
# reply past it resolves to nothing rather than to a row the guest never saw.
# The letters are kept as an alias for the numbers — a guest holding an older
# card in their scrollback still gets an answer, and the resolver is scoped on
# the active prompt, so those letters do not collide with the AC menu's own
# 1/2/3 (see app/utils/room_card_reply.py).

# What a card row is numbered with. Keycap emoji, not "1." — the card text is
# handed to `st.markdown` in chat_ui.py:264, and Markdown reads a line starting
# "1." as an ordered-list marker and renders the line without it. The code emits
# "1. Economical"; the guest sees "Economical" and is then asked to "Reply 1-2".
#
# Keycaps survive every renderer this card passes through: Markdown leaves them
# alone, and WhatsApp — which supports only *bold* and _italic_, no lists —
# shows them as digits. The rest of the bot already numbers with keycaps
# (`_card_party`'s menus above), so this is the house style, not a workaround.

    The mattress line: the room sleeps this many, and a bed costs this much.

    *"Hey if you can adjust your 3 people in this room / bed for 2 thats good
    BUT If you need an extra bed / matress that can be added on too for blabla
    price."* The point of it is that the bed reads as something the guest may
    choose, not something bundled into a price they never agreed to.

    `base_seats` is the room's own `base_adult_occupancy` — the number the
    card's ROOMS list prints as "max N", and the number the guest has to fit
    into if they decline the mattress. It is None on a set of several room
    types, where there is no single capacity to quote, and the line then states
    the price without claiming a berth count.

    "Adjust" is on every note that can quote a capacity, including a party
    larger than the beds — 3 guests in a room that sleeps 2, which is Ayush's
    own example, gets it. The gate is his and it is not `base_adults`: it is the
    room's `max_adult_occupancy` covering the party, which is the hotel saying
    the room takes that many people. Every row on this card has already cleared
    it (`min_cost_packing` seats the party or the row is not drawn), so there is
    nothing left to test here.

    The stay total that used to close this line — `(₹5,700 total with it)` — is

    CONFRIMATION card, wherever this case is true that 'No extra bed for N
    people'."* Hotel Sahu's Deluxe Room King Bed is the case he named:
    `base_adults` 2, `max_adults` 3, so three guests sleep there with no bed
    added and nothing extra charged.

    The card already implies this -- it prints a rate and no mattress line --
    but implying it is not stating it. A guest who asked for three people and
    sees no bed line cannot tell whether the bot understood, quietly dropped a
    charge, or is about to bill them at check-in. The line answers that.

    Only ever called when no mattress was charged AND the party outnumbers the
    room's own berths, so it cannot appear on a row that did buy a bed.

    Always plural. `_seat_lookup` maps a stored 0 to None, so a room that
    reports berths reports at least one -- and the caller only reaches this line

    asked for the rate and nothing else on the option rows; the header already
    says `1-3 Oct (2N)`, so the total was the nights multiplied out one line
    under a rate the guest can multiply themselves. Dropping it also removed the
    only reason this function needed the nights or the allocator's stay figure,
    so both parameters went with it — a total that is never printed cannot
    disagree with the rates above it.

    The per-room breakdown is the point of the card: `2 x Deluxe Family Room —
    ₹7,760/night` makes the guest take the figure on trust, and the earlier card
    did exactly that. Naming each room's own rate is what lets them check it,
    and a mixed set still shows the sum, so the arithmetic is visible even
    though the stay total is not.

    A set carrying a mattress prints two lines: the room, at what the room
    costs, and beneath it the bed at what the bed costs. Until 2026-09-24 it
    printed one, `₹2,250 + ₹600 extra bed = ₹2,850/night`, which tells the guest
    the bed is part of the set. It is not — see `_bed_note`.

    A bedded set's room line is `total_per_night - bed_charge`, never the
    option's own figure, because that figure *includes* the mattress and would
    show the bed in the room price and again on the note beneath it. On a set
    with no bed the option's own figure is printed unchanged.

    The `ROOMS` list — one line per room type, at the price the combinations use.

    This is the half of the card that was deleted and is now restored, and the
    reason it was deleted is the reason it is built this way: the old list was
    drawn from the catalogue's **static** rates while the combinations beneath
    it were priced from the **calendar**, so one card quoted Deluxe at Rs 2,550
    and charged Rs 3,000.

    Both halves are therefore sourced from `_card_candidates`, which reads its
    prices out of the allocator's own options. That is a second call to a pure
    function on the same inputs rather than a shared intermediate, so the two
    cannot disagree — the alternative was widening `card_rows`' return shape,
    which nine tests and two probes unpack.

    Rooms the packer refuses (no base occupancy, or no calendar price) are left
    off rather than shown at Rs 0. They cannot appear in a combination either,
    so listing them would advertise something the card cannot sell.

    The capacity printed is `base_adults` — the figure the packer fills to —
    and not the booking system's `max_occupancy`. Ayush confirmed the
    distinction on 2026-09-19 ("Capacity shown: 4 / Capacity in system: 5"):
    this card adds a room rather than a bed, so a maximum the hotel will never
    actually sell to one party is a number the guest cannot use.

    Filtered to the guest's own AC class, and never wider. Until 2026-09-24 it
    was also widened by every room the combinations quoted, because
    `cheapest_and_comfy` made the comfortable row AC even for a guest who asked
    for non-AC, and a guest looking at "1 x Deluxe Family" with no Deluxe
    Family rate above it was the fault that got this list deleted the first
    time. The rows no longer cross classes, so the union has nothing left to
    add; it is kept as a guard so a row can never cite a rate this list did not

    One RoomCandidate per room type the allocator priced, plus its rate by name.

    The two halves come from two places on purpose. **Price** comes from the
    option, because that is the calendar-resolved rate for the guest's own
    dates — the catalogue's static price is not what they will be charged.
    **Base occupancy and AC class** come from the catalogue document, because
    the option carries neither.

    **The seating capacity** is the catalogue's `max_adults` — the hotel's own
    adult ceiling for the room — and **the mattress** is read off the option's
    `extra_adult_charge`, which is non-zero only where the guest actually asked
    for one. Both were `base_adults + (assigned_adults - base_adults)` until
    2026-09-25, which said a room seats only what the room rate covers plus one
    berth per mattress. A Deluxe King (base 2 / max 3) therefore drew as
    "Sleeps 2" without a bed, so a party of three who declined the mattress
    looked unseatable and was answered with two rooms. See `distribute_guests`.

    The mattress is deliberately not re-derived from the hotel's policy here:
    the allocator is the one that read `extra_bed_allowed`, and a second opinion
    could quote a mattress the final quote refuses.

    Two candidates can share a name — one Deluxe with a mattress and one without
    — so the de-duplication is keyed on the pair. Keyed on the name alone, as it
    was, the bedded one would silently lose to whichever came first.

    A room whose catalogue document cannot be resolved is skipped rather than
    defaulted. Guessing its capacity would let the packer quote a set the hotel

    The card: a ROOMS list, lettered combinations, and a build-your-own line.

    This is the two-section shape restored, and the earlier attempt at it is
    worth knowing about because two of its three faults are what the current
    implementation is built to avoid:

      * The list and the combinations were drawn from two different price books
        — the catalogue's static rates against the calendar-resolved ones — so
        one card quoted Deluxe at Rs 2,550 and charged Rs 3,000. Both sections
        are now priced from `_card_candidates`, i.e. from the allocator's own
        options.
      * The list was capped at four, so a party of three was offered "1 x Family
        Room" in the combinations while the Family Room's rate appeared nowhere
        on the card. The list is uncapped now, and it is filtered by the same AC
        class as the combinations, so the two halves describe one set of rooms.
      * It was, at six rooms and four combinations, "too big". That one is a
        real trade and it is why this card carries no tier names and no
        per-room split for single-room sets: the lines that earn their place are
        the ones the guest is choosing between.

    Capacity is printed as `base_adults`, the figure the packer fills to, not
    the booking system's `max_occupancy`. Ayush settled this on 2026-09-19
    ("Capacity shown: 4 / Capacity in system: 5"): this card adds a room rather
    than a bed, so a maximum the hotel will never sell to one party is a number
    the guest cannot use. Confirmed with Pranav on 2026-09-21.

    A row the allocator cannot supply is dropped rather than invented; if that
    leaves nothing, the allocator's own first options are shown so the guest
    still gets a card.

    The fallback exists so a guest always gets a card, and it is only ever
    reached when the packer's sets matched nothing. That is exactly the state a
    one-room-type catalogue leaves the allocator in: when a room-type preference
    narrows the pool to a single room type, `allocate_rooms` can only emit one
    shape of set, and the first two entries of its pool are the SAME set at the
    SAME price — often the same `option_id`, because the engine numbers as it
    goes. The card then drew "A. 3 x Deluxe Room King Bed" and "B. 3 x Deluxe
    Room King Bed" as two different choices, which is the live complaint this
    whole card rewrite started from.

    Two identical rows are not one bad row out of two: they are a choice the
    guest cannot make, printed as if it were one. So the fallback walks the pool
    and keeps the first `want` DISTINCT sets, counted the way `_match_option`
    counts them — the sorted room names — and returns fewer rows, or none, when
    the pool has nothing distinct left to say. A short card is honest; a padded

# ── Extra-bed note (client requirement, 2026-09-19) ──────────────────────────
#
# "When suggesting an extra bed, mention 'You can add an extra bed.'"
#
# The client's own wording, so it is a constant rather than a sentence we
# phrase ourselves, and it stays English in Hinglish chats for the same reason.
# It rides under any option whose `extra_adult_count` is above zero — which is
# the only sense in which the bot "suggests an extra bed": the bed is already
# in the title and already priced, and the guest needs to be told it is an
# addition they are choosing rather than something quietly folded into the rate.
#
# It is deliberately *not* added to options that carry no bed. Printing "you can
# add an extra bed" under a room that cannot take one would be a promise the
# allocation engine will refuse to keep.
EXTRA_BED_NOTE = "🛏️ You can add an extra bed."
