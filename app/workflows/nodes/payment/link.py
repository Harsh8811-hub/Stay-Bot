    What to say *instead of* asking for money, when the CRM says staff already confirmed.

    `None` means "carry on and ask for payment" — the lookup is off, the CRM holds nothing
    on this guest, or its confirmation names a different stay than the one being priced.

    Two rules this has to get right:

    1. **Suppress, never confirm.** The CRM holds no payment record, no amount paid and no
       booking id, so a wrong label must cost the guest a wait — never a room. We do not
       touch `payment_status` or mark anything paid here.
    2. **Match the stay.** The confirmation is keyed on the phone number, not on a
       booking, and it is sticky (measured: 70 of 167 unrefreshed, oldest 11 days). A
       returning guest's *new* enquiry therefore inherits their old confirmation. When both
       sides name a check-in date and they disagree, this is a different stay and the guest
       does owe for it — so we do not suppress.

    Never raises: the repository swallows its own failures and answers `None`.
