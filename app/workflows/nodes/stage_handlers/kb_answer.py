"""One way for a guest who has already booked to get an answer from the KB.

Pranav, 2026-10-11: *"making the bot in faq mode if booking confirmed"*, then
*"faq mode till check out"*. Two stages need this — the confirmed guest and the
in-house guest — and `checked_out` may follow. It lives here rather than copied
into each handler so the two cannot drift, and so the guard below is written
once.

Why it is needed at all: `routing.py:40` returns `stage_confirmed` for every
`lifecycle_stage == "confirmed"` turn *before* the `intent == "FAQ"` branch at
`routing.py:99`, and the in-house router does the same. So the knowledge base is
unreachable for a booked guest unless the stage handler calls it itself. Both
stages used to end in a fixed paragraph instead — so "what is the wifi password",
"do you allow pets" and "is there a restaurant" all got the same non-answer while
the hotel's own knowledge base sat unread.

Three things the call must NOT be allowed to do. Each returns `None`, and the
caller falls back to its own canned line:

  * Move the guest out of the stage. `handle_faq` spreads the incoming state, so
    it preserves the stage today — but that is a property of a different module,
    and re-asserting it here is what keeps the guest where the resolver put them.
  * Sell. Two ways this leaks, and both are guarded below.
  * Raise. `handle_faq` reaches Gemini, ChromaDB, Mongo and the persona
    rewriter; a knowledge-base failure must cost the guest a fallback sentence,
    never a turn with no reply.

# ── The ZERO SELLING guard ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `handle_faq`'s own guard is `next_action == "rooms_shown"` — a redirect to
# `handle_room_query`, which shows option cards. That was the leak this file was
# written for and it is checked below. It is NOT the only one, and that is the
# measured finding behind this regex:
#
#   Guest (confirmed): "show me available rooms"
#   Answer:            "Sure, here are the room types available at Hotel Sahu:
#                       DELUXE ROOM KING BED … Rate Plans: CP (Breakfast…"
#
# That came back as `next_action == "faq_answered"` — a plain knowledge-base
# answer, waved through by the `rooms_shown` check — because the hotel's room
# list and rate plans are *in* the knowledge base, and Gemini will happily recite
# them. Measured 2026-10-11 against `staychat_web_clone`; at HEAD the same
# message got the canned paragraph.
#
# So the question is filtered, not the answer. Filtering the answer is tempting
# and wrong: "does the deluxe room have AC?" is a factual question whose answer
# names a room type, and blocking on room names would send that guest to the
# front desk for a question the bot can answer. The set the bot must not serve is
# *inventory and prices* — and that is a property of the question.
