    Name the AC class that emptied the search, and what is actually free.

    AC / Non-AC is a hard filter — `allocate_rooms` returns nothing rather than

    room is free these nights" while several AC rooms sit open. The generic
    "we don't have rooms available that match your requirements" card is the

    which part of the request failed and what the hotel does have.

    Both non-AC types were closed on the 20th, two AC types were free on all
    three nights, and the guest received the same sentence three times before a
    staff member answered by hand with a room at another property.

    existing no-rooms card in place. None is the right answer whenever there is

    # ── AC / NON-AC / BOTH: PRICE (client, 2026-09-19; revised 2026-09-19) ──
    #
    # There used to be a room-description card here, sent when the guest
    # answered the AC question and built from an LLM call over the filtered
    # catalogue. The client has dropped it: the priced card below answers the
    # same question in three lines, and the description contradicted it on
    # price (static catalogue rates against the card's calendar rates), on
    # capacity (`_effective_max_occupancy` against the booking system's
    # `max_occupancy`) and on which rooms were in the guest's AC class
    # (`recommendation_engine._matches_feature` against
    # `allocation_engine.room_matches_feature`, since unified).
    #
    # `ac_details_pending` and `build_ac_details_message` went with it.

    # If the user explicitly selected a custom composite configuration, auto-select those specific rooms.
    # Otherwise, ALWAYS present room options to the guest so they can choose.
    #
    # A guest-stated per-room split is the second case, and it is here rather
    # than in `booking_stage` for a reason worth keeping: the stage is NOT a
    # reliable signal for it. `understand` sets `custom_rooms_selected`, and
    # then its own hard-reset block assigns `booking_stage = "collecting"`
    # afterwards whenever the change touched a capacity field — which a split
    # always does, because accepting one writes `num_rooms`. The requirements
    # survive that reset (`understand.py`, the wipe is guarded on
    # `extracted.room_requirements is None`); the stage does not. So the
    # condition reads the requirements, which are the thing that is actually
    # true, instead of a stage that was true one node ago.
    #
    # This is the whole fix and not a detail: the ordinary card cannot deliver a
    # split. Its rows are re-derived cheapest-first and any packing it cannot
    # reproduce is dropped, so an explicit set reaches `card_rows` and returns
    # **zero** rows — the guest gets today's generic card back, silently. The
    # only path that quotes an explicit set verbatim is this one.
    #
    # `available` is a guard, not decoration: `best_option = available[0]` below
    # is unguarded, and the split condition is what newly makes an empty list

    #
    # Trigger: five or more ADULTS, with no upper bound (client, 2026-09-19).
    #
    # It used to be `5 <= total_pax < 8` AND more than three viable
    # arrangements. Both bounds are gone. The ceiling silently stopped asking
    # for exactly the parties that need it most — the ones where "fewer rooms
    # with beds" and "more rooms" diverge by thousands a night — and
    # "more than three arrangements" measured the four composition modes, which
    # no longer exist.
    #
    # Adults, not headcount, and that is a deliberate line rather than the
    # leftover it looks like. Five adults is where the arrangement space
    # explodes — one triple, two doubles, a family room plus a single — and the
    # guest needs the question to narrow it. Children do not add arrangements
    # in the same way: they are assumed to settle in with the adults, so 4
    # adults + 3 children is a room-count question the search answers on its
    # own. Kept as `> 4` to say five, since that is the number the client named.
    #
    # `adults` here is `effective_adults`, NOT the raw count. That is the half
    # that fixes the reported case: 4 adults + one 16-year-old at Hotel Sahu is
    # five adults once the hotel's own child policy is applied, so it asks. The
    # gate never had to change for that — the number reaching it did.
    #
    # A guest who has named a room TYPE or a budget has answered it, and asking
    # again is the thing that reads as a bot not listening. The surviving
    # `viable_count > 1` is the old intent kept intact: the question is only
    # worth asking when the guest actually has a choice, and with one
    # arrangement both answers lead to the same card.
    # `num_rooms` is deliberately NOT in this list any more. It used to be, on
    # the theory that a guest who named a room count had answered the question.
    # They have not: `room_service.find_suitable_rooms` throws the count away
    # for every party of five or more before the search runs, so the count is
    # not honoured anywhere downstream — it only ever suppressed this question.
    # A guest who says "5 people, 1 TBR & 1 DBR" was therefore neither asked how
    # to split nor given the two rooms they named; they got a generic
    # combinations card. Asking is the honest half of that pair.
