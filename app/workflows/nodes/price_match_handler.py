    # Two versions of the same offer, and the difference is one clause: the

    # discount?" with no dates, which reaches this line with no screenshot and
    # nobody having mentioned MakeMyTrip. Naming a portal the guest did not
    # raise is an unasked-for claim about a competitor's price; naming one they
    # did raise is the answer to their question. Pranav's rule, 2026-10-14.

    # The hotel's own switch rides along: a property that has turned OTA
    # comparison off must not have portals named for it at all, whatever the
    # guest asked. Default is True, so on every hotel today only the guest's
    # own words decide — which is what makes this a fix rather than a dark flag.
    # Imported here rather than at module scope because the sibling import at
    # line 193 sits inside a `try` that only runs on the screenshot path, so it
    # is not bound by the time this branch is reached.
