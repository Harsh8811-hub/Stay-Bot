"""
Validator Node — checks what booking info is present/missing.

Pure Python logic — no AI. Decides what the graph should do next based on state
completeness.

No DB calls either. A 2026-10-10 attempt to have this node ask the guest about
early check-in / late check-out did add one (to see whether the hotel sells it),
and it was removed the same day: the bot does not raise that question. The guest
raises it, and `intent_overrides` answers it — see `_EARLY_LATE_ASK` there.
