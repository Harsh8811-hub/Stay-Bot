"""
Read-only reader for the CRM's staff-confirmation signal.

Why this exists
---------------
A stay can be confirmed by staff in the Control Centre. That confirmation is written
into the CRM's own database and stops there — nothing carries it into the bot's
`bookings` collection. The bot's stage resolver therefore still reads `pending_payment`
and re-enters the payment flow, so a guest who has already paid is asked for the
advance again. Measured on hotel 111111, 2026-10-11: the guest paid, staff confirmed
and sent the voucher at 15:55, and at 06:37 the next morning the bot minted a *new*
booking and demanded ₹8,040.

This module answers exactly one question: **does the CRM believe this guest's stay is
already confirmed?**

It is deliberately NOT a booking lookup. The CRM holds no payment record, no amount
paid and no booking id — `bookingAmount` is present on only 56% of its confirmed
contacts, and there is no field anywhere naming what was actually received. So it can
never be the source of truth for money, and the caller must use this only to
**suppress** a payment demand, never to confirm a booking or release a room.

Two properties are load-bearing:

1. **It never raises.** A CRM outage, a timeout, a missing collection or a malformed
   document must all read as "unknown", because the alternative is losing the guest's
   reply. Every failure returns `None`.
2. **It is ON by default.** `CRM_CONFIRMATION_LOOKUP_ENABLED` and
   `CRM_CONFIRMED_STAGE_ENABLED` both default to `True`, so merging code that calls
   this changes live behaviour immediately — there is no "off until someone flips a
   flag" safety net here. The rollback is a revert commit.

Schema notes, all measured 2026-10-12 against the CRM's live data:
  - the hotel is `hotelID` (capital ID) at both the top level and inside
    `classification`; the snake-case `hotel_id` is empty on every document;
  - `phone_number` is `91` + 10 digits on 162 of 167, but 11 digits on 5 — so match on
    the last 10 digits rather than assuming a length;
  - `confidence` sits beside the intent, and 3 of 167 confirmed contacts are below 0.9
    (all three also carry no dates and no amount);
  - the intent is phone-scoped, not booking-scoped. There is exactly one `contact` per
    phone today, so a returning guest's next enquiry inherits the previous booking's
    confirmation. That is tolerable *only* because the caller suppresses rather than
    confirms.
